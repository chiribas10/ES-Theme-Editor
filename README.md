ES Theme Editor

A small application designed to simplify the process of creating themes for Emulationstation as much as possible. At the moment the program can open an existing set of themes, read XML markup, generate XML markup, move elements on a special form to provide more convenient and visual positioning of items on the screen.

Thanks Ury Jamshy for the color selection dialog he developed, which I used in my application.
